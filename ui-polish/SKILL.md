# UI polish

Great interfaces rarely come from a single thing. It's usually a collection of small details that compound into a great experience. Apply these principles when building or reviewing UI code. Before suggesting or writing a fix, identify the project's existing styling system and express the change in that system: Tailwind in a Tailwind project, plain CSS in a CSS project, or the established CSS-in-JS approach. Never introduce a second styling system just to apply a polish fix.

When reviewing, slow the interface down: replay motion at 10% speed in the browser's Animations panel and walk every state: hover, focus, active, loading, empty. What feels off at 10% speed is what's subtly wrong at full speed.

## Core principles

### 1. Concentric Border Radius

Outer radius = inner radius + padding. Mismatched radii on nested elements is the most common thing that makes interfaces feel off.

### 2. Optical Over Geometric Alignment

When geometric centering looks off, align optically. Buttons with icons, play triangles, and asymmetric icons all need manual adjustment.

### 3. Shadows for Elevation, Borders for Structure

For buttons, cards, and containers whose border exists only to create depth, prefer layered transparent `box-shadow` values. Keep borders that communicate structure or state: dividers, layout separators, and selected or focus states.

### 4. Interruptible Animations

Use CSS transitions for interactive state changes — they can be interrupted mid-animation. Reserve keyframes for staged sequences that run once.

### 5. Split and Stagger Enter Animations

For an infrequent staged entrance where sequence helps communicate hierarchy, break content into semantic chunks and stagger them by ~100ms instead of animating one container. Do not stagger routine, high-frequency interactions.

### 6. Subtle Exit Animations

For exits that do not need full spatial travel, use a small fixed `translateY` instead of full height. Exits should be softer than enters. Use `ease-out` for both enter and exit transitions.

### 7. Contextual Icon Animations

Animate icons with `opacity`, `scale`, and `blur` instead of toggling visibility. Use exactly these values: scale from `0.25` to `1`, opacity from `0` to `1`, blur from `4px` to `0px`. If the project has `motion` or `framer-motion` in `package.json`, match that package's import path (or the established nearby imports when both exist) and use `transition: { type: "spring", duration: 0.3, bounce: 0 }` — bounce must always be `0`. If no motion library is installed, keep both icons in the DOM (one absolute-positioned) and cross-fade with CSS transitions using `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)` — this gives both enter and exit animations without any dependency.

### 8. Font Smoothing

Apply `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased` to the root layout on macOS for crisper text.

### 9. Tabular Numbers

Use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for any dynamically updating numbers to prevent layout shift.

### 10. Text Wrapping

Use `text-wrap: balance` on headings. Use `text-wrap: pretty` for body text to avoid orphans.

### 11. Image Outlines

Add a subtle `1px` outline with low opacity to images for consistent depth. The color must be pure black in light mode (`oklch(0 0 0 / 0.1)`) and pure white in dark mode (`oklch(1 0 0 / 0.1)`), never a near-black like slate, zinc, or any tinted neutral. A tinted outline picks up the surface color underneath it and reads as dirt on the image edge.

### 12. Scale on Press

A subtle `scale(0.97)` on click gives buttons tactile feedback. Always use `0.97`. Never use a value smaller than `0.95` — anything below feels exaggerated. Add a `static` prop to disable it when motion would be distracting.

### 13. Skip Animation on Page Load

Use `initial={false}` on `AnimatePresence` to prevent enter animations on first render. Verify it doesn't break intentional entrance animations.

### 14. Never Use `transition: all`

Always specify exact properties: `transition-property: scale, opacity`. Tailwind's `transition-transform` covers `transform, translate, scale, rotate`.

### 15. Use `will-change` Sparingly

Only for `transform`, `opacity`, `filter`; measure whether compositing helps the affected interaction. Never use `will-change: all`. Only add when you notice first-frame stutter.

### 16. Minimum Hit Area

Interactive elements should prefer a 44×44px hit area for touch or mobile contexts. In dense desktop interfaces, use at least 40×40px. Extend with a pseudo-element if the visible element is smaller. Never let hit areas of two elements overlap.

### 17. Match Icon Stroke to Text Weight

An icon next to text carries the text's optical weight: `1.5px` stroke beside regular (400) text, `2px` beside semibold (600). One stroke weight per icon set; never mix libraries on one surface.

### 18. One SVG, Recolored per State

Icons use `currentColor` and get their states (hover, selected, disabled) from CSS color and opacity, never from separate assets. Outline variant is the default; fill variant marks the active state.

### 19. Motion Restraint

No custom animation on high-frequency interactions: the attention cost repeats on every trigger. Motion is never the only feedback channel; every animated state change also needs a static cue such as color, icon, or label.

## Review evidence

- **Location**: cite `path/to/file:line`. If the artifact has no source files, cite the exact screen and component instead.
- **Before / After**: show the current implementation and an actionable replacement.
- **Why**: name the violated principle and explain its user impact.

Never imply an uninspected surface was reviewed.
